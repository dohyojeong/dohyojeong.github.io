Write a critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)\nThe following graph is a graph posted on ‘news1’, one of the Korean media. This shows Korea’s GDP growth over the past decade in percent.\n\nWhen we first looked at this graph, it seems that Korea’s GDP growth has fluctuated in recent years. It also appears to have declined sharply. But if we look closely at the graph, we can see that there is a trick. If you look at the graph’s x-axis, the years are not increasing from left to right. In this graph, the years are increasing from right to left. Taking this into account and looking at the graph again, Korea’s GDP growth did not change much. Most people unconsciously understand the passage of time from left to right. Therefore, the graph expressed in this way is highly likely to cause people’s misunderstand."
