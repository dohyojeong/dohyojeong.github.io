Write a critique on a chart in published work (book/article/news website)\nThe following graph is a graph posted on ‘news1’, one of the Korean media. This shows Korea’s GDP growth over the past decade in percent.\n\nWhen we first looked at this graph, it seems that Korea’s GDP growth has fluctuated in recent years. It also appears to have declined sharply. But if we look closely at the graph, we can see that there is a trick. If you look at the graph’s x-axis, the years are not increasing from left to right. In this graph, the years are increasing from right to left. Taking this into account and looking at the graph again, Korea’s GDP growth did not change much. Most people unconsciously understand the passage of time from left to right. Therefore, the graph expressed in this way is highly likely to cause people’s misunderstand."

This implies that developed countries have more strict policies toward property rights and as countries become more developed there are higher chances that the country will protect their property rights.\nComparing graph 2(a) and 2(b)\nRegarding property rights by country, we see that a majority of developing nations have ‘middle’ level property rights; whereas, all developed nations have “high” level property rights. Additionally, developing states have varying degrees of property rights, with ‘high’ level rights being the lowest amount possessed, and ‘middle’ rights being the highest amount possessed. This graph supports the literature; where, developing nations lack the institutional structure to possess high-level property rights for its citizenry while developed nations hold the contrary to be true.\nAlso, it is more convenient to see the count between developed and developing countries via graph 2(B) but (A) shows more information such as the mean, variance, skewness, etc. This allows us to understand the property rights of developed and developing countries in more depth.\nGraph 2 (c).\nThis scatter plot with two lines shows the negative correlation between property rights and political corruption for both developed and developing countries. Based on the slope of the developed countries, it is shown that the correlation between property right and corruption is less sensitive, whereas the correlation between property right and corruption in developing countries have a stronger relationship. Moreover, blue dots are gathered around a higher political corruption rate, implying that developing countries tend to have higher political corruption than developed countries."
