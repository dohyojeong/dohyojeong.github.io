    "text": "The research focuses on identifying regional disparities in resource allocation within global public health systems and understanding the underlying causes and consequences. Various analytical methodologies, including causal inference, machine learning, and geographic information systems (GIS), are utilized to explore these disparities. The research is framed around three key perspectives: Public Health Crisis Management, Public Health Services Planning, and the Social Impact of Public Health Crises.\n\n\n\n1. Public Health Crisis Management\nEpidemic patterns and regional impacts of disparities are central areas of study. A collaborative study in Nigeria, funded by the United States Agency for International Development, identified tuberculosis hotspots (published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance). This study demonstrated the importance of identifying spatial patterns for early detection and resource allocation in TB cases.\nA follow-up study investigated the influence of geographical accessibility and supply-demand dynamics on the initiation and timing of TB treatment. Results indicated that proximity to TB treatment facilities and a higher supply-to-demand ratio significantly improved timely treatment initiation, while gender-specific barriers contributed to delays (Dissertation Chapter 1).\n\n\n2. Public Health Services Planning\nAnother key research area focuses on optimizing demand forecasting and resource allocation strategies for emergency medical services (EMS). Research on traffic accident patterns and emergency response times in Nigeria, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), revealed regional disparities and proposed solutions to improve emergency response efficiency (published in BMC Public Health).\nFurther research on EMS demand forecasting in Busan, South Korea, utilized machine learning techniques such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to predict fluctuations in EMS demand. This work emphasized the need for dynamic resource allocation strategies for regional and temporal demand variations (Dissertation Chapter 2).\n\n\n3. Social Impact of Public Health Crises\nResearch also delves into the societal impacts of public health crises, such as pandemics, on resource allocation and access disparities. Studies on COVID-19 treatment supply-demand imbalances identified regional characteristics that contribute to these disparities, providing insights for targeted interventions (Dissertation Chapter 3). Additionally, research explored the impact of public health crises on education, revealing how regional inequalities in educational resources and infrastructure worsen academic disparities during such crises (published in Sustainability). Another study focused on the influence of public health crises on crime patterns, showing that social and economic instability during these times can exacerbate regional disparities in crime rates (published in Journal of Criminal Justice).Social media’s role in shaping public sentiment during pandemics was also examined, emphasizing the need for effective government communication strategies (published in Behavioral Sciences).\n\n\n\n4. Ongoing Paper and Future Research Directions\n\n1) Community-Based Health Disparities\nFuture research will explore health disparities at the community level, focusing on the impact of regional characteristics, infrastructure, and access to resources on health outcomes. Projects in this area include:\n\nDisaster Shelter Accessibility: An ongoing study examines the accessibility of national shelters in Florida during disaster situations. The research aims to identify vulnerable areas and propose strategies for ensuring equitable access to shelters during emergencies by analyzing regional factors such as population density, infrastructure, and socioeconomic status.\nRegional Disparities in Education: Another project focuses on the regional disparities in student performance following the transition to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights how these factors exacerbate educational inequalities by examining the variability in digital infrastructure and access to educational resources, providing important policy insights for addressing these gaps.\n\nThese efforts aim to address disparities arising from community-level differences, offering actionable public health and educational policy solutions.\n\n\n2) Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling in Public Health\nThis area of research applies machine learning techniques to predict health outcomes and improve healthcare strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations. Current projects include:\n\nKidney Transplant Readmission Rates: In collaboration with a nursing professor in South Korea, a machine learning model is being developed to analyze factors contributing to readmission rates among kidney transplant patients. This study emphasizes the role of individual patient characteristics—such as age, gender, and comorbidities—in predicting readmission, to improve personalized healthcare strategies and reduce readmission rates.\nCancer Incidence in Kidney Transplant Patients: A matching study is being conducted to explore cancer incidence disparities among kidney transplant patients by gender. By identifying underlying factors contributing to these disparities, the research aims to inform tailored medical interventions that can improve outcomes for this population.\n\n\n\n3) Spatial Analysis and Geographical Accessibility\nSpatial analysis is key in understanding how geographic factors affect healthcare access and resource allocation. Current projects utilizing spatial methodologies include:\n\nDisaster Shelter Accessibility: As mentioned above, this project uses spatial analysis to assess shelter accessibility in Florida. The study evaluates regional factors like population density and infrastructure to pinpoint areas with limited access, ultimately guiding more equitable disaster preparedness strategies.\nHealthcare Resource Allocation: Future research will continue to employ spatial statistics to analyze patterns of resource allocation and healthcare accessibility. The goal is to understand how geographical disparities contribute to health inequalities and develop targeted interventions that address these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n[5] DOHYO JEONG, Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, and Dohyeong Kim.
